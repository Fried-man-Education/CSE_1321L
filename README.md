# 1321L
This repo is all the code written for 1321L's problem sets. I figured it would be easier to keep track of all my code for the course if I dropped it on GitHub. So here it is. [Live List of Problem Sets Here](https://ccse.kennesaw.edu/fye/1321_labs_assignments.php). Final Grade in class: 100%. Grade for Final Exam: 100%. Very Epic. For some of the assignments, extra credit was offered (hence the weird grades towards the end). Labs were turned in during class and assignments were for homework turned in online. There was no grading feedback for the assignments so I have zero clue what I did wrong on them. Sometimes, I would convert my "imperfect" pseudocode into source code and they would give me a perfect score. This made no sense to me considering they are the exact same functionally but in a different language. [Live Rules of KSU Pseudocode](https://ccse.kennesaw.edu/fye/pseudocode/pseudocodeguide.php). Anyways, enjoy!
## Course Description
This course provides an introduction to computing with a focus on programming. Instruction centers on an overview of programming, problem-solving, and algorithm development. Particular topics include object-oriented design/programming, primitive data types, arithmetic and logical operators, selection andrepetition structures, interactive user input, exception handling, using and designing basic classes, single-dimensional data structures with searching and sorting, and arrays. Programming assignments focus on techniques of good programming style including proper documentation. The student is taught to efficiently design, code, and debug problem solutions and the relationship between correct code and security.
